# Language of Bits

Language_of_Bits is a concise reference explaining how information is represented and manipulated at the bit level. It covers core concepts (bits, bytes, binary), how bits behave in logic and arithmetic, common encodings, and practical examples showing how low-level binary constructs map to higher-level representations.

Purpose
- Explain what bits are and how they form the "language" computers use.
- Provide clear, short definitions and examples for learners and engineers.

Repository structure
- `assets/` — images and visual aids.
- `notes/readme.md` — guide to the notes folder and reading order.
- `notes/terms_definition.md` — glossary of terms and short definitions.

How to use
- Read `notes/readme.md` for an overview and suggested reading order.
- Use `notes/terms_definition.md` as a quick glossary while learning.
