# Language of Bits — Notes

This folder contains short notes and a glossary to help you understand how computers represent and manipulate information at the bit level.

Why read these notes?
- Bits are the smallest unit of information in computing. Understanding them clarifies how higher-level abstractions (numbers, text, images) are actually stored and processed.
- These notes are intentionally short and practical — ideal for quick reference or revision.

Suggested order
1. Read `notes/terms_definition.md` to learn the key terms and their meanings.
2. Return to examples or images in `assets/` to visualize concepts.

How to contribute
- If you find an explanation that can be improved, submit a pull request following CONTRIBUTING.md.

Learning outcome
- After reading, you should be comfortable with binary notation, basic logic gates, simple encodings (ASCII/UTF-8), and common bitwise operations.
